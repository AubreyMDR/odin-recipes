    can make almost anytime without having to do groceries. In fact, it's perfect

   <p>If you're just starting out in your cooking journey, Japanese Curry
    is a really great recipe to dip your hand into. It's also quite versatile.
    You can have a vegetarian version, having boiled egg or tofu as your protein option.
    It can also have your more traditional chicken or beef, making it perfect
    for the everyday family. In this recipe we will go over the vegetarian version, but you
    are free to substitute it with the protein of your choice!</p>
