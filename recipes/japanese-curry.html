    <p>If you're just starting out in your cooking journey, Japanese Curry
        is a really great recipe to dip your hand into. It's also quite versatile.
        You can have a vegetarian version, having boiled egg or tofu as your protein option.
        It can also have your more traditional chicken or beef, making it perfect
        for the everyday family. In this recipe we will go over the vegetarian version, but you
        are free to substitute it with the protein of your choice!
